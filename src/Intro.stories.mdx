# Get started

Darkla UI is a reusable component library based on the Storybook Design System and helps developers create user interfaces with more agility.
The goal is to make user interface creation more productive and satisfying.

## Install

Darkla UI components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df).
It requires Storybook version 5.x and up.

Add Darkla UI to your project.

`npm install --save @darklauncher/darkui`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button, Badge } from ‘@darklauncher/darkui’;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Badge onClick={this.clear}>Cool</Badge>
    </div>
  )
```

### **Browse Darkla UI components in your own Storybook**

Once you add the package, update your .storybook/config.js to import all files ending in .stories.js.

```
  import { configure } from '@storybook/react';
  configure(require.context('../src', true, /.stories.js$/), module);
```

### **Run and develop Darkla UI locally**
